          <div class="accordion-body">After enrolling at Hunter College to study film, Mitski decided to pursue music instead and transferred to SUNY Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, where she studied studio composition. During her time at Purchase, she recorded and self-released her piano-based first and second albums, Lush (2012) and Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013), as student projects. While there, Mitski met Patrick Hyland, who has produced her albums after Lush. In 2013, she collaborated with indie-rock artists Mike Rasimas and Mutsawashe Mangwendeza, providing vocals for the original song Ego and a cover of "Nightcall" by Kavinsky.
            After graduating, she served as the vocalist for the short-lived prog-metal band Voice Coils and began work on her third studio album, Bury Me at Makeout Creek, which was released on November 11, 2014, through Double Double Whammy. The album was reissued with four bonus tracks on April 7, 2015, through Don Giovanni Records. The album's raw, impulsive guitar represented a sonic departure from the orchestral and classical piano sounds of her first two albums. It garnered acclaim from numerous publications. However, it failed to become a significant commercial success.        </div>

She announced her fourth studio album, Puberty 2, on March 1, 2016, and shared the lead single, "Your Best American Girl". She released another single, "Happy", before the release of the album on June 17. Produced by Hyland, the album was recorded over two weeks at Acme Studios in Westchester County, New York. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics. "Your Best American Girl" was named the 13th best song of the 2010s by Rolling Stone. Her song "Francis Forever" was covered by Olivia Olson as the character Marceline the Vampire Queen in a 2016 episode of the Cartoon Network show Adventure Time.
On February 21, 2017, Pixies announced U.S. tour dates with Mitski as a supporting act. On May 1, a compilation album consisting of 100 songs by various artists titled Our First 100 Days was released. It includes Mitski's cover of One Direction's song "Fireproof". The compilation aims to raise funds for organizations that support causes threatened by Donald Trump's proposed policies. Mitski played a cover of the song in 2015, but that version has since been taken down. Mitski also covered Frank Sinatra's 1951 classic "I'm a Fool to Want You" for the 7-Inches For Planned Parenthood compilation album. On October 4, 2017, Lorde announced that Mitski would open for her on some dates on her Melodrama World Tour. On November 1, a short film starring Mitski called Sitting was released.        </div>
